# Metrocar-Funnel-Analysis
An analytical project aimed at studying the behavior of users of the MetroCar app, a car rental service.


## Overview
Metrocar is a ride-hailing platform similar to Uber or Bolt.  
This project analyzes the full user funnel â€” from app download to leaving a review â€” to identify where users drop off and what factors influence retention.

---

## Objectives
- Build a complete **user funnel** and calculate conversion rates at each step  
- Identify **drop-off points** and investigate potential reasons for user loss  
- Analyze **cancellation behavior** by time of day, day of week, and initiator (driver vs passenger)  
- Assess **platform efficiency** (iOS, Android, Web)  
- Examine **age group activity and revenue patterns**

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Database: PostgreSQL
- **SQL** for data extraction and aggregation
- **Excel / Google Sheets** for calculations
- **Tableau** for dashboards

---

## Key Insights
- Only **26.4%** of users who download the app complete a ride  
- **52%** of users drop off before requesting their first ride  
- **35%** of all requests are cancelled by users, mainly when waiting exceeds **10 minutes**  
- The **iOS platform** leads with 60% of total rides and users  
- **35â€“44 age group** is the most active and profitable  
- **35% of users** have unknown age â€” indicating missing demographic data

---

## Recommendations
- Reduce **waiting time** below 10 minutes to minimize cancellations  
- Improve **onboarding flow** after signup to motivate first ride  
- Focus marketing on **iOS users** and **35â€“44 age group**  
- Encourage users to fill in **age data** during registration  
- Implement **incentives** (discounts/bonuses) for delayed rides or feedback submission
